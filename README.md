# Conic Classifier

The purpose of the algorithm implemented in the provided C code is to analyze a given quadratic equation and determine the type of conic section that it represents (ellipse, hyperbola, parabola, or special cases). The algorithm achieves this by performing the following tasks:

Input Coefficients: The user inputs the coefficients of the quadratic equation, which can include square roots. The algorithm allows the user to specify coefficients with or without square root terms.

Conic Section Classification: The algorithm examines the coefficients of the quadratic equation to determine the type of conic section it represents. It considers the presence of linear and constant terms, as well as the properties of the coefficients to distinguish between ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas.

Reduction and Property Calculation: If the equation represents an ellipse or hyperbola, the algorithm performs a translation to a new coordinate system using the translation() function. This translation helps determine properties such as the center, axes lengths, foci, eccentricity, and more. For parabolas, the calculating_parabola() function calculates the focus, directrix, and eccentricity.

Print Conic Section Properties: Based on the classification of the conic section, the algorithm calculates and prints various geometric properties of the conic section. These properties include the coordinates of foci, vertices, directrices, eccentricity, axes lengths, and more, depending on the type of conic section.

User Interaction: The algorithm engages the user by allowing them to confirm or re-enter the coefficients. It also informs the user about the nature of the conic section represented by the equation.

Memory Management: The algorithm properly allocates memory for a 3x3 matrix and deallocates it after use.
